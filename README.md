# TRIAGING AND CLINICAL SUPPORT SYSTEM

## ABSTRACT
 
### BACKGROUND
 
The Triage Based System is used by Medical receptionists (medical administrative assistants, unit secretaries or patient coordinators—are administrative professionals within a healthcare setting) to determine which groups of the patients should receive treatment and care services based on their clinical status, the prognosis of disease and available resources.

Injuries caused by emergencies and accidents are increasing in the world. To prioritise patients to provide them with proper services and to optimally use the resources and facilities of the medical centres during accidents, the use of triage systems, which are one of the key principles of accident management, seems essential.


### AIM

This project is an attempt to identify available triage systems with possible diagnosis/prescription and compare the differences and similarities of the standards of these systems during emergencies and disasters through a review study.


### METHODS

This project was conducted through a review of the triage systems used in emergencies and disasters throughout the world. Accordingly, all the symptoms/vital based on patient's age and gender will determine the proper triage system in emergency cases in hospital (Keywords : Disasters, Triage, Mass Casualty Incidents, Review). 


### CONCLUSION

There are divergent triage systems in the world, but there is no general and universal agreement on how patients and injured people should be triaged. Accordingly, these systems may be designed based on such criteria as vital signs, patient’s major symptoms, or the resources and facilities needed to respond to patients’ needs. The system will find the triage purely based on what groupd have made in an application.
